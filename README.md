# BMP180 Barometric Pressure/Temperature/Altitude Sensor- 5V ready
## How to Set Up the BMP180 Barometric Pressure Sensor on an Arduino
### The BMP180 barometric pressure sensor is a great sensor that can be used to predict the weather, detect altitude, and measure vertical velocity. It’s perfect for weather stations, remote controlled vehicles, weather balloons, and lots of other projects. It’s an extremely sensitive sensor too. As you’ll see in a minute, it can detect changes in altitude of just a few inches.
### The BMP180 is a piezoresistive sensor that detects pressure. Piezoresistive sensors are made up of a semiconducting material (usually silicon) that changes resistance when a mechanical force like atmospheric pressure is applied.
### The BMP180 measures both pressure and temperature, because temperature changes the density of gasses like air. At higher temperatures, air is not as dense and heavy, so it applies less pressure on the sensor. At lower temperatures, air is more dense and weighs more, so it exerts more pressure on the sensor. The sensor uses real-time temperature measurements to compensate the pressure readings for changes in air density.
