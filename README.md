# BMP180 Barometric Pressure/Temperature/Altitude Sensor- 5V ready
## How to Set Up the BMP180 Barometric Pressure Sensor on an Arduino
### The BMP180 barometric pressure sensor is a great sensor that can be used to predict the weather, detect altitude, and measure vertical velocity. It’s perfect for weather stations, remote controlled vehicles, weather balloons, and lots of other projects. It’s an extremely sensitive sensor too. As you’ll see in a minute, it can detect changes in altitude of just a few inches.
